<h3>YARA and YARA Rules</h3>

YARA is a powerful pattern-matching tool and rule format used for identifying and classifying files based on specific patterns, characteristics, or content. SOC analysts commonly use YARA rules to detect and classify malware samples, suspicious files, or indicators of compromise (IOCs).

YARA rules are typically written in a rule syntax that defines the conditions and patterns to be matched within files. These rules can include various elements, such as strings, regular expressions, and Boolean logic operators, allowing analysts to create complex and precise detection rules. It's important to note that YARA rules can recognize both textual and binary patterns, and they can be applied to memory forensics activities as well.

When applied, YARA scans files or directories and matches them against the defined rules. If a file matches a specific pattern or condition, it can trigger an alert or warrant further examination as a potential security threat.
